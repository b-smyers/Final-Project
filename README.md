# Final-Project
Final project for EE3613 to create a functional CPU using verilog.

Simulator: [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/x/DvKG)

Instruction Set Architecture: [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AWa7mW1QGrK1qnBrIkxLehCps6AoY9p40mo6DNU3bHo/edit?usp=sharing)

## Conclusion
This CPU is by no means complete, and should not be assumed so. There are issues with the branching logic that still need resolved and the ISA is still sparse. Despite these setbacks, we have achieved our goal of creating a semi-functional CPU that successfully implements these instructions: ADD, ADDI, SUB. There are more instructions implemented than are used by our sample program and thus could be working, but were not tested due to time constraints.
